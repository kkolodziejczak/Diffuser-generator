# Softbox-generator
Uses OpenSCAD to generate 3d model that when 3d printed will evenly soften the light that will pass through it.

# Origin
Inspired from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3375497. But there is used special slicing software, because of that I didn't want to bother with it. After a while I come up with the solution to create OpenSCAD program that will generate model for me, and It will be able to be sliced with any slicer that there is. Infill will be generated automatically.
